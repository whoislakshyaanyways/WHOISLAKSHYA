The platform automatically adds a geo tag and a timestamp to the picture and submits the complaint to the appropriate government authority. Another thing is we can make communities for cities and states where people can discuss the civic sense of people there so it becomes competitive to have their state or city more civic forward and there will also be a leaderboard",

On the software side, it functions as a task manager, habit tracker, journal keeper, and personal assistant, where users can log tasks, reflect on their day, and track consistency over time. The hardware component is a physical bot that uses OpenCV to follow the user’s movement and interact in real time. It listens to voice input to capture tasks, habits, and daily checklists, syncing them with the user’s digital journal. The bot features two displays: one expressive screen that shows emotions as animated eyes, creating a sense of personality, and a second display that presents daily tasks, habit progress, journal entries, and text-based responses—making productivity feel more personal and alive rather than mechanical.",

Using the Pomodoro technique, users work in timed sessions (25–120 minutes) to construct or upgrade buildings on a 10x10 city grid. Completing a session successfully builds or upgrades a structure, while quitting early leaves ruins, giving immediate visual feedback. Over time, the city evolves with day/night cycles, animated buildings, and ambient sounds, creating a unique skyline that reflects the user’s focus habits. The app saves progress locally, letting users watch their personal city grow as they stay productive.",
